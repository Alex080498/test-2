All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple o' years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, trying to put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

I saw the world a couple times, tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole, and my mind kept playing tricks on me
Feeling older every day, took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me me
