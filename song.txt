All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple o' years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, trying to put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room
